Not managed to work continuously on this so may be gaps in commit times
Tests written in SoapUI, which is avaible from https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui.html
To run the tests simply intall SoapUI and load the xml in this repo.
A repeasted issue that was encountered was that some requests returned 204 status instead of 200 and therefor no content data for assertion (verification)
I have not added these to the tests but used basic assertion methods (due to lack of time) 
Not all test were completed as per the planned test cases (some are just a shell) but stopped after about 2 hours work as requested
I do not think this is the complete list of test cases but as above stopped due to lack of time.
